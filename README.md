I was reacently learning Python and found out about PygLatin. I was impressed by the idea of it. I made a function that would convert an english word to PygLatin. But I also wanted a function that would translate it back to english too, but I was amazed to find that there was no piece of code on internet that would do it. So, I decided to write one myself and publish it on the internet as to help anyone who doesn't understand it, understand it.

It simply takes the third last word and transfers it back to its rightful index, i.e. index 

I am a beginner at Python, so I was not knowing how to access the third last character if the length of the word was unknown.

But now that I have done it, I have shared the code with all my friends and now we can communicate without anyone knowing what we are talking about.
